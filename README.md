Simply reads the file word by word to find some vulnerables functions


-- HOW DOES IT WORKS ? --

For now, I simply read the file word by word and compare each word to the name of some functions I gave.


-- TO DO LIST -- 

-Not to take into account line starting with //
-Using a wordlist instead of theses messy functions
